# Product Context: TaskNova

## 1. Problem Statement

In modern workplaces, employee well-being is increasingly recognized as a critical factor for productivity, engagement, and retention. However, identifying and addressing issues like stress, burnout, and disengagement in a timely and empathetic manner remains a challenge. Employees may struggle to manage their tasks effectively when their mood is not aligned with their work, leading to decreased performance and job satisfaction. Organizations often lack proactive tools to understand the collective emotional pulse of their workforce or to provide personalized support that enhances both well-being and productivity.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

- **Empathetic & Supportive:** The system should feel like a supportive tool, not a surveillance mechanism. Interactions should be positive and encouraging.
- **Intuitive & Seamless:** Emotion detection (where active, e.g., text input analysis) and task recommendations should integrate smoothly into existing workflows if possible, or be very easy to access.
- **Actionable Insights:** Information provided to all user types should be clear, concise, and lead to actionable steps.
- **Trust & Transparency:** Users must understand how their data is being used, collected, and protected. Clear privacy policies and anonymization techniques are crucial.

- **Non-Intrusive:** The system should not be overly demanding of user attention. Alerts should be timely but not overwhelming.
